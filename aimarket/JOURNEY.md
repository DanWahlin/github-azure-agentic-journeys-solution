# AIMarket

> ✨ **Build a full-stack marketplace from a spec document, with AI features from search to checkout.**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/aimarket-marketplace.webp" alt="AIMarket — AI-Powered Marketplace" width="800" />
</p>

In this agentic journey, you'll build AIMarket, a lightweight marketplace app with AI-powered product search and a shopping assistant. You'll hand GitHub Copilot a spec document and watch it scaffold an API in your chosen language, generate a React storefront, add AI features, and deploy the whole thing to Azure.

## Learning Objectives

- Use a spec/plan document as shared context for GitHub Copilot to scaffold an entire application
- Build a REST API with products, orders, and users in your choice of language (Node.js, Python, .NET, or Java)
- Build a React storefront that consumes the API
- Add semantic product search with Azure AI Search
- Build an AI shopping assistant with Microsoft Foundry
- Deploy the full stack to Azure Container Apps using `azd`

> ⏱️ **Estimated Time**: **3–5 hours first run** (about 2–3 hours if you've done an OSS journey and know Container Apps). The per-phase estimates below are hands-on time only — the 3–5 hour total includes the test, debug, and fix loops that the phase numbers don't.
>
> 💰 **Estimated Cost**: ~$100–115/month **if left running** (AI Search Basic is ~$75 of that; see [Cost Breakdown](#cost-breakdown)). **Tear down the same day with `azd down --force --purge`.**
>
> 📋 **Prerequisites**
>
> - Azure CLI, Azure Developer CLI 1.28.0+, and an agentic coding tool
> - Node.js 24 LTS or later for the frontend, cross-platform hooks, and default API stack
> - GitHub CLI (`gh`) for the repository and issue workflow in Phases 2–3
> - The selected API runtime if you choose Python 3.10+, .NET 8+, or Java 17+ instead of Node.js
>
> Run `az version`, `azd version`, `node --version`, and `gh auth status` before starting. Deployment images build in Azure Container Registry; the host does not need Docker or Buildx. See the [cross-platform installation guide](../docs/tool-installation.md) for Windows, macOS, and Linux options.

> [!NOTE]
> Use [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli), the [GitHub Copilot app](https://github.com/features/ai/github-app), or another agentic coding tool. For other tools, run: **"Copy or adapt this repository's `.github/skills` into your supported skills or instructions location, preserving their behavior and reporting anything unsupported."**

### Done when

You can check these off before cleanup:

- [ ] `GET /api/health` returns OK locally
- [ ] Product grid shows seed products in the browser
- [ ] Place order decrements inventory
- [ ] Semantic search returns relevant products (or SQLite fallback documented)
- [ ] Chat assistant mentions a real catalog product
- [ ] Deployed API + web URLs work; products load in production browser
- [ ] `azd down --force --purge` completed (or scheduled immediately)

**Azure resources created:**

- **Azure Container Apps**: Serverless hosting for the API and frontend
- **Database**: SQLite embedded in the API container (default). Swappable to Cosmos DB or PostgreSQL via `DATA_PROVIDER` env var
- **Azure AI Search** (Basic tier): Semantic product discovery
- **Microsoft Foundry** (AIServices): gpt-5-mini shopping assistant
- **Azure Container Registry**: Docker image storage
- **Azure Log Analytics**: Monitoring and diagnostics

> ⚠️ **Data persistence note:** The default deployment does **not** provision a database — SQLite lives inside the API container, so orders and inventory changes are lost whenever the container restarts or scales to zero. That's fine for this lab (the [Grafana journey](../grafana/README.md) explores the same ephemeral-storage tradeoff). If you want persistent data, that's what the repository pattern is for: ask GitHub Copilot to add a Cosmos DB or PostgreSQL module to the Bicep and set `DATA_PROVIDER` accordingly.

---

## The Spec

AIMarket is driven by a spec document: [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) in this journey folder. It defines the data models, API contracts, validation rules, and seed data. You don't need to read the whole thing. GitHub Copilot reads it for you and generates code that matches.

**Core data model (the parts you'll build):**

| Entity | Key Fields | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Product** | id, name, description, price, category, tags, inventory, rating | Marketplace catalog |
| **Order** | id, userId, items[], total, status (pending → confirmed → shipped → delivered) | Purchase tracking |
| **User** | id, email, name, role (buyer/seller) | Account management |

**API endpoints you'll generate:**

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/products` | List products with pagination and filtering |
| `GET` | `/api/products/:id` | Get a single product |
| `POST` | `/api/products` | Create a product (sellers) |
| `POST` | `/api/products/search` | AI-powered semantic search |
| `POST` | `/api/orders` | Place an order |
| `GET` | `/api/orders/:id` | Get order details |
| `POST` | `/api/users/register` | Register a new user |
| `POST` | `/api/chat` | AI shopping assistant |

---

## The Journey

AIMarket is built in four phases. Each phase uses a different agentic AI workflow: interactive prompting, code review, delegation, and deployment. The [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) spec is your shared context throughout.

**How this journey works:** You won't paste one giant prompt and get a finished app. Instead, you'll build incrementally: ask GitHub Copilot for a piece, inspect what it generated, test it, fix issues, and then move on. This is how developers actually work with AI: generate → inspect → test → refine.

> **💡 Tip: Track issues as you go.** When giving GitHub Copilot a prompt, add *"If you encounter any issues, log them to issues.md so they can be tracked and fixed."* This gives GitHub Copilot a place to record problems it finds or fixes during generation, making it easier to iterate and debug.

### Phase 1: Build the API from the Spec (~25 min)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/spec-to-code.webp" alt="Phase 1: Spec to Code" width="800" />
</p>

You'll build the API in stages, not all at once. Each step teaches a different aspect of working with GitHub Copilot.

#### Step 1: Set up the project

From the solution repository root, change to the existing journey directory so GitHub Copilot can access the skills and agent definitions in `.github/`:

```text
cd aimarket
```

Start GitHub Copilot. Examples use the [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/cli-getting-started); the app and VS Code agent chat work the same — type the prompts without the leading `>`:

```bash
copilot
```

If you haven't installed the Azure Skills plugin yet, do it now — it's a one-time setup that adds deployment tools, Bicep schema lookups, and infrastructure generation (details in the root [Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start)):

```
> /plugin marketplace add microsoft/azure-skills
> /plugin install azure@azure-skills
```

#### Step 2: Generate the data models

Start with just the data models, not the whole API. This lets you inspect the generated code before building on top of it.

> **Default stack:** Node.js + TypeScript + Express. Prefer another language? Swap it in the prompt and use PLAN.md’s Choose Your Stack table.

```
> Read the PLAN.md file in this directory. Create a Node.js/Express with TypeScript
  project in an api/ subdirectory (or my chosen stack if I say otherwise).
  Initialize the project with the standard build files.
  Then create just the data models from the Phase 1 spec: Product, Order 
  (with OrderItem and ShippingAddress), and User. Include validation functions 
  for each model. Use the recommended framework from the Choose Your Stack 
  table in the spec. If you encounter any issues, log them to issues.md.
```

**🔍 Inspect what was generated:**

Open the Product model file. Look for:
- Does the `Product` type match the PLAN.md fields? (id, name, description, price, category, tags, etc.)
- Does validation check that `price > 0` and `category` is from the allowed list?
- Are the constraints right? (name 1-200 chars, inventory >= 0)

If anything's off, tell GitHub Copilot:

```
> The Product validation doesn't check that category is one of the allowed 
  values from the spec. Fix it to reject invalid categories.
```

**💡 What you're learning:** GitHub Copilot reads your spec and generates types + validation, but you still need to verify it matched, especially constraints and edge cases. It usually gets the shape right but always double-check.

#### Step 3: Generate the data layer with repository pattern

Now add the database layer. The spec calls for a repository pattern so you can swap SQLite for Cosmos DB later without changing route code.

```
> Read the Data Access Layer section in PLAN.md. Create the repository pattern 
  for [YOUR LANGUAGE]:
  1. Repository interfaces/protocols for Product, Order, and User
  2. SQLite implementation using the recommended library from the Choose Your Stack table
  3. A factory that reads DATA_PROVIDER env var (default: sqlite)
  4. Seed data from the PLAN.md tables with exact IDs
  Store tags as JSON strings in SQLite and parse them on read.
```

**🔍 Inspect what was generated:**

Open the SQLite implementation file and look for:
- **Tags storage:** SQLite has no array type. The spec says to store tags as JSON strings (`'["laptop","ultrabook"]'`) and parse them on read. Is that how tags are stored and read?
- **Order items:** Are they in a junction table (`order_items`) or embedded? The spec says junction table.
- **Seed orders:** Do they decrement inventory? They shouldn't; they're historical data.

```
> Show me how tags are stored and retrieved in the SQLite implementation. 
  Are they JSON strings in SQLite, parsed to arrays on read?
```

**💡 What you're learning:** The repository pattern is a real architectural decision, not boilerplate. Separating interfaces from implementation means Phase 4 (deployment) is straightforward: you write a new Cosmos DB or PostgreSQL implementation that follows the same interfaces. You're also seeing how SQLite's limitations (no arrays, no nested objects) force serialization workarounds.

#### Step 4: Generate the API routes

Now add the route handlers that use the repository interfaces.

```
> Create route handlers for products, orders, users, and chat. Each should 
  receive a DataStore (repository) parameter — never import the database 
  directly. Follow the endpoint specs in PLAN.md Phase 1. Also create a 
  global error handler matching the error format from the spec, and the 
  main entry point with CORS, JSON body parsing, a GET /api/health endpoint, 
  and all routes mounted at /api.
```

**🔍 Inspect what was generated:**

Check the order creation route. This is the most complex endpoint. Look for:
1. Does `POST /orders` validate that all product IDs exist and are active?
2. Does it check inventory before creating the order?
3. Does it decrement inventory after creating the order?
4. Does it capture `priceAtPurchase` from the product's current price (not from the request)?
5. Does it calculate `total` server-side?

If any of these are missing, ask GitHub Copilot to fix them one at a time:

```
> The POST /api/orders endpoint doesn't capture priceAtPurchase from the 
  product's current price. It's using the price from the request body, 
  which means a buyer could send any price. Fix it to look up each 
  product's price from the database.
```

**💡 What you're learning:** Complex business logic is where AI generation needs the most human review. Agentic coding agents normally get CRUD right but sometimes miss multi-step validation (check inventory → decrement → capture price → calculate total). Reviewing order creation teaches you to look for these gaps.

#### Step 5: Test the API yourself

Don't ask GitHub Copilot to claim it tested the API. Generate a reusable cross-platform verifier, run it yourself, and inspect the output.

1. Check that the preferred API port is free. If it is already in use, select another port instead of stopping the unrelated process.
2. Start the API with its documented `PORT` or equivalent setting.
3. Generate `scripts/verify-api.mjs` using Node.js `fetch`. The script must read `API_URL` and default to the selected local URL.
4. Run:

```text
node scripts/verify-api.mjs
```

The verifier must fail with a nonzero exit code unless all of these pass:

- `GET /api/health` returns JSON and HTTP 200.
- `GET /api/products` returns all 10 seed products.
- `GET /api/products?category=Electronics` returns only the three electronics products.
- `GET /api/products/prod-1` includes the full description.
- `GET /api/products/nonexistent` returns the documented 404 error envelope.
- Creating an order decrements inventory by the requested quantity.
- Updating a product to `64.99` succeeds, while a three-decimal price such as `64.991` fails validation.

If any check fails, describe the exact request, expected result, and actual result to GitHub Copilot. Keep the verifier in the generated project so the same checks work from PowerShell, Command Prompt, Bash, and CI.

```
> The category filter isn't working — GET /api/products?category=Electronics 
  returns all 10 products instead of just 3. Check the SQL query in the 
  SQLite implementation.
```

**💡 What you're learning:** Testing yourself (instead of delegating to GitHub Copilot) builds understanding. After this, you know what the API returns, how inventory decrement works, and where to look when something breaks in production.

### Phase 2: Build the Storefront (~20 min)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/react-storefront.webp" alt="Phase 2: React Storefront" width="800" />
</p>

#### Step 1: Generate the React frontend

```
> Create a React frontend for AIMarket in a client/ directory using Vite, 
  TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The frontend is always React regardless of 
  your API language. Read the Phase 2 spec in PLAN.md. Build:
  - Product grid page with search bar and category filter buttons
  - Product detail page with Add to Cart
  - Shopping cart page with Place Order
  - A ChatWidget component that shows "Coming in Phase 3" as a stub
  Set up a Vite proxy so /api requests go to http://localhost:[YOUR API PORT].
```

#### Step 2: Run both services together

You need the API and frontend running at the same time. Ask GitHub Copilot to set this up:

```
> Create a way to start both the API and the React frontend with a single 
  command from the project root. The API runs in api/ and the frontend 
  runs in client/. I want to run one command and see both start.
```

Start both services, then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

**🔍 Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`:**

- Do all 10 products display with images, prices, and ratings?
- In the browser network panel, do all 10 image requests return HTTP 2xx? Treat a broken seed image as a journey failure and replace it with a verified URL before continuing.
- Does typing in the search bar filter products?
- Click "Electronics". Do only 3 products show?
- Click a product → does the detail page load with the full description?
- Add 2 items to the cart → does the cart icon show "2"?
- Go to the cart → are quantities and totals correct?
- Place an order → do you see a confirmation with an order ID?

#### Step 3: Fix something yourself

The generated frontend might have issues. Here are common ones to look for:

- **Cart doesn't update the icon badge** → Check that `CartContext` is properly wired
- **Product images are broken** → Check the `imageUrl` format in seed data
- **Search doesn't filter by tags** → The search function may only check `name`

Pick one issue (or find a real one) and fix it with GitHub Copilot:

```
> The search bar only matches product names but not tags. When I search 
  for "wireless" I should see the headphones. Update the filter logic 
  in ProductGrid to also search tags.
```

**💡 What you're learning:** Frontend code generation is less reliable than API code because there are more subjective decisions (layout, state management, error handling UX). You're learning to spot and fix these gaps quickly.

#### Step 4: Push to GitHub

You'll need a GitHub repo for Phase 3's cloud agent workflow. Stay in this journey folder:

From the journeys repository root, change to `journeys/aimarket`, then run:

```text
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "AIMarket: API + React storefront"
gh repo create aimarket --private --source=. --push
```

> **Nested repo note:** `git init` here creates a git repo *inside* the cloned journeys repo. That's intentional — the cloud agent needs its own repo to work against. The outer repo will show `journeys/aimarket` as an untracked embedded repository; that's harmless, just don't commit it to the journeys repo. Run these commands from `journeys/aimarket`, never from the repo root.
>
> Work only under `journeys/aimarket` for the rest of this journey. Do not copy the app to `~/aimarket`.

---

### Phase 3: Add AI Features (~30–45 min)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/ai-search-and-chat.webp" alt="Phase 3: AI Features" width="800" />
</p>

This phase teaches two things: how to integrate Azure AI services, and how to delegate work to the Copilot cloud agent instead of doing everything through the CLI.

#### Step 1: Local AI credentials (optional before Phase 4)

**Recommended:** Skip creating standalone AI resources here. Implement search + chat with **graceful fallbacks** (SQLite LIKE for search; chat returns 503 without credentials). Phase 4 Bicep provisions **Azure AI Search + Microsoft Foundry** and wires env vars into Container Apps.

**Optional local AI now:** If you want live semantic search and chat before deploy, have GitHub Copilot create an uncommitted `.env.local` containing `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_SEARCH_KEY`, `AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`, and `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`. Add the file to `.gitignore` and load it through the selected framework instead of placing credentials in shell history. Use existing Search and Foundry resources, or create temporary resources and delete them immediately after testing.

Do **not** create a second long-lived Search/Foundry pair if you are about to run Phase 4 — you will pay twice.

#### Step 2: Add semantic product search (interactive CLI)

This one you'll do interactively so you can see how search integration works.

```
> Add Azure AI Search integration to AIMarket. Read the "AI Feature 1" 
  section in PLAN.md for the full spec. Create the search index, add a 
  POST /api/products/search endpoint with semantic ranking, and add a 
  script to push products to the index. Use the Azure AI Search SDK 
  recommended in PLAN.md for my language.
```

**🔍 Inspect the search service code:**

Open the search service file. Key things to understand:
- The search index has a **semantic configuration**. This is what makes "lightweight for travel" match "UltraBook Pro" even though those words don't appear together
- The endpoint does a **two-step process**: search returns IDs and scores, then full product details come from your database
- There's a **fallback**: when Azure credentials aren't set, it uses a SQLite LIKE query instead

Extend `scripts/verify-api.mjs` with semantic assertions, then rerun it. It must prove that “something lightweight for travel” returns the UltraBook product and “gift for a kid” returns the castle set or another valid toy without relying on exact string matching alone.

> **No results?** If search returns no results, make sure products have been pushed to the search index. Restart the API (which indexes on startup) or call `POST /api/products/reindex`.

**💡 What you're learning:** Semantic search is an API call, not a machine learning project. Azure AI Search handles embeddings and ranking. You push documents to an index, query with natural language, and merge the results with your database.

#### Step 3: Delegate the shopping assistant to the cloud agent

Now try a completely different agentic workflow. Instead of prompting GitHub Copilot interactively, you'll write a GitHub issue and let the GitHub Copilot cloud agent implement it asynchronously.

**Why delegate this one?** The shopping assistant is well-scoped (one endpoint + one component) with clear acceptance criteria in the spec. That makes it a good candidate for async delegation since you don't need to be in the loop for every decision.

**Option A: Delegate from your GitHub Copilot session**

If your surface supports it (e.g. Copilot CLI `/delegate`), delegate asynchronously:

```
> /delegate Create the AI shopping assistant for AIMarket. Read PLAN.md
  in the root of the pushed AIMarket repository for the full spec — see
  "AI Feature 2: Shopping Assistant"
  under Phase 3. Implement the POST /api/chat endpoint using the Microsoft Foundry
  SDK for my language. The endpoint should fetch all products and include them 
  in the system prompt. Also add a ChatWidget component to the React frontend. 
  Use the acceptance criteria in PLAN.md Phase 3 to verify your work.
```

**Option B: Create an issue and assign GitHub Copilot cloud agent**

Create `issue-body.md` with this content:

```markdown
## What
Add the AI shopping assistant to AIMarket.

## Spec
Read PLAN.md in the root of the pushed AIMarket repository. Implement:
1. **POST /api/chat** endpoint (see 'AI Feature 2: Shopping Assistant' in Phase 3)
   - Uses the Microsoft Foundry SDK for this project's language
   - Fetches all products and injects them into the system prompt
   - Accepts a messages array for conversation history
   - Returns the assistant's response
2. **ChatWidget** React component (see Phase 2 ChatWidget spec)
   - Floating button bottom-right, expands to chat panel
   - Message list + text input
   - Sends full history with each request

## Acceptance Criteria
- POST /api/chat with 'What laptops do you have?' mentions UltraBook Pro 15
- Assistant does not invent products outside the catalog
- Multi-turn conversation works (follow-up questions)
- ChatWidget opens, sends messages, displays responses
- If Azure credentials are missing, endpoint returns 503
```

Create the issue with one shell-neutral command:

```text
gh issue create --title "Add AI shopping assistant (chat endpoint + ChatWidget)" --body-file issue-body.md
```

Then assign it to the GitHub Copilot cloud agent. Navigate to the issue on GitHub and click **"Assign to Copilot"**.

While the cloud agent works on it, you can move on to Phase 4 or take a break. When it opens a PR:

```bash
gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER>
# start both API and frontend, then test the chat endpoint and widget locally
```

**🔍 Review the PR like you would any code review:**

- Does the system prompt include the product catalog? (It should fetch products on each request, not hardcode them)
- Does the code avoid setting a custom temperature? (gpt-5 family models reject non-default temperature values — only set `0.7` if you're on the gpt-4.1 fallback)
- Does the ChatWidget send the full message history, or just the latest message?
- What happens when `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` isn't set? (Should return 503, not crash)

If something's off, comment on the PR and let the agent fix it. Then merge:

```bash
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER>
```

> **If the agent's PR doesn't work:** After 2 rounds of feedback, close the PR and implement it yourself interactively using the "AI Feature 2: Shopping Assistant" section in PLAN.md. Not every task is a good fit for delegation, and that's a lesson too.

**💡 What you're learning:** The cloud agent workflow is different from CLI prompting. You write a well-scoped issue with acceptance criteria, delegate, and review the result. It works best for self-contained tasks where there's a spec the agent can read and the acceptance criteria are testable. You'll get a feel for when to drive interactively vs. when to hand something off.

### Phase 4: Deploy to Azure (~30–45 min first time)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/azure-deployment.webp" alt="Phase 4: Deploy to Azure" width="800" />
</p>

Before generating Bicep, confirm the model exists in your region:

```bash
az cognitiveservices model list --location westus \
  --query "[?model.name=='gpt-5-mini' || model.name=='gpt-4.1'].{name:model.name, version:model.version}" -o table
```

#### Step 1: Generate infrastructure

The Phase 4 spec in PLAN.md and the `container-apps-deployment` skill already contain every infrastructure requirement (resources, Dockerfiles, the postdeploy hook), so the prompt stays short — this is the "spec is the prompt" idea applied to infrastructure:

```
> Read the Phase 4 section in PLAN.md and the container-apps-deployment skill
  at ../.github/skills/container-apps-deployment/SKILL.md. Following the
  Containerization, Azure Resources, Bicep Requirements, and Deployment
  sections exactly, create everything needed to deploy AIMarket to Azure
  Container Apps: Bicep in infra/, Dockerfiles with .dockerignore files for
  api/ and client/, azure.yaml with API remoteBuild: true, and the required
  postdeploy ACR build hook wired into azure.yaml. Default stack: Node.js API
  + React client. Do not require local Docker or Buildx.
  Set the location to westus. Log issues to issues.md.
```

**🔍 Before deploying, review these critical details:**

1. Open `infra/main.bicep`. Do both Container Apps have `azd-service-name` tags? The `api` tag lets azd map its declared service; the `web` tag lets the postdeploy hook discover the storefront. The web app is not an azd service.
2. Is there an Azure Container Registry resource? Without it, there's nowhere to push images.
3. Open `api/Dockerfile`. Does it use the correct base image for your language? If using Node.js with `better-sqlite3`, it needs native build tools (`python3 make g++`).
4. Open `client/nginx.conf`. Does it ONLY have `try_files` for SPA routing? No `/api/` proxy block. (With public ingress on Container Apps, each service has its own URL, so nginx proxying to `aimarket-api` will crash because that hostname doesn't resolve.)
5. Open `client/.dockerignore`. Does it exclude dependency directories (`node_modules/`, `.git/`)? Without this, the Docker build context is huge and may fail.
6. Open `api/.dockerignore`. Make sure it does NOT exclude build config files like `tsconfig.json`. The Docker build needs them to compile.
7. Open `client/Dockerfile`. Is it compatible with an ACR `linux/amd64` cloud build, and are `ARG VITE_API_URL` and `ENV VITE_API_URL=$VITE_API_URL` **before** `npm run build`?
8. Do both Container Apps use system-assigned identity, an `AcrPull` assignment, and an explicit ACR registry entry using `identity: system` before a private image is deployed?
9. Does the API service in `azure.yaml` set `docker.remoteBuild: true` and `platform: linux/amd64`? Without this, `azd up` can require local Docker.
10. Does `azure.yaml` define `hooks.postdeploy` → `infra/hooks/postdeploy.js` without `shell: sh`? Without this, the storefront will load HTML but products will fail.

**💡 What you're learning:** Deployment infrastructure has sharp edges that break silently. Missing service tags = deployment succeeds but app doesn't update. Missing `.dockerignore` = disk space errors. Wrong nginx config = container crashes on startup. The postdeploy hook exists because Vite bakes `VITE_API_URL` at **build** time—the API FQDN is only known **after** provision.

#### Step 2: Deploy

Read the subscription ID with `az account show --query id -o tsv`, pass the returned value to `azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID <subscription-id>`, then run `azd up`.

> ⏳ **While you wait:** Azure is building your Docker images and provisioning Container Apps, AI Search, and Foundry. While it runs:
>
> 1. Watch resources in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) or `az resource list --resource-group rg-<env-name> --output table`.
> 2. Open `infra/hooks/postdeploy.js` and trace how `VITE_API_URL` is set after deploy.
> 3. Think about why the API and frontend are *separate* Container Apps. What are the scaling implications?

Deployment may take several minutes. If it fails, ask GitHub Copilot to help diagnose:

```
> azd up failed with this error: [paste the error]. What's wrong?
```

#### Step 3: Confirm the frontend API URL (should be automatic)

The **postdeploy hook** should have rebuilt the web image with `VITE_API_URL=<API_URL>/api`. Confirm products load at `WEB_URL`. If they do not:

```
> The frontend can't reach the API. Run or fix infra/hooks/postdeploy.js.
  It must read API_URL with azd, run az acr build with API_URL + "/api",
  target linux/amd64, and update the web Container App without interpolated
  shell commands. On Windows, use the static PowerShell JSON-payload launcher
  required by the container-apps-deployment skill.
```

<details>
<summary>Manual fallback: run the portable frontend hook</summary>

For a storefront-only rebuild, run the JavaScript hook directly:

```text
node infra/hooks/postdeploy.js
```

The hook must read all dynamic values through `azd env get-value`, call Azure CLI with argument arrays, build the image with `az acr build`, and verify that the updated Container App reaches `Running` before exiting. The host must not need Docker or Buildx.

</details>

**💡 What you're learning:** Build-time env vars for SPAs are a classic multi-service deploy problem. Production teams use postdeploy hooks, runtime config injection, or two-stage CI/CD so the first deploy still ends green.

#### Step 4: Verify the live deployment

Generate `scripts/verify-deployment.mjs` and run it from Windows, macOS, or Linux:

```text
node scripts/verify-deployment.mjs
```

The script must read `API_URL` and `WEB_URL` with `azd`, then require HTTP 200 from `/api/health`, 10 products from `/api/products`, a rendered storefront containing a known product, and no failed product-image requests.

Open the value returned by `azd env get-value WEB_URL` in your browser. You should see the product grid with 10 products. If you see "Failed to load products," the `VITE_API_URL` isn't set correctly. Go back to Step 3.

Also check the browser dev tools Network tab. Product requests should go to `https://ca-api-xxx.../api/products`, not `/api/products` (the relative path means the fix didn't take).

#### 🧪 Try it yourself: Add an endpoint

Now that you have the full workflow down, add something on your own:

```
> Add a PUT /api/orders/:id/status endpoint that updates an order's status. 
  Only allow valid transitions: pending → confirmed → shipped → delivered, 
  or pending → cancelled. Return 400 if the transition is invalid.
```

Test it, deploy it with `azd up`, and verify it works in production.

## How Agentic AI is Used

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/generate-inspect-test-refine.webp" alt="Agentic AI Development Workflow" width="800" />
</p>

Here's where agentic AI shows up in this journey:

| Layer | Use Case | What It Demonstrates |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| **Code generation** | GitHub Copilot scaffolds models, routes, and data layer from a spec | Break work into pieces, inspect each one, iterate on gaps |
| **Code review** | You review generated code for business logic correctness | AI gets structure right but misses edge cases; you catch them |
| **Delegation** | Cloud agent implements a feature from a GitHub issue | Write well-scoped issues with acceptance criteria, review the PR |
| **Product search** | Azure AI Search with semantic ranking | AI-powered features are API calls, not ML projects |
| **Shopping assistant** | Microsoft Foundry grounded in product catalog | Ground LLMs in real data to prevent hallucination |
| **Infrastructure** | GitHub Copilot generates Bicep templates and Dockerfiles | Review deployment config carefully; silent failures are common |
| **Debugging** | Ask GitHub Copilot to diagnose deployment failures | Describe errors, let AI suggest fixes, verify yourself |

</details>

## Cost Breakdown

| Resource | SKU | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| Container Apps (2 apps, scale-to-zero) | Consumption | ~$10-20 |
| Azure AI Search | Basic (semantic ranking) | ~$75 |
| Microsoft Foundry (AIServices) | Pay-per-token (gpt-5-mini) | ~$5-10 |
| Container Registry | Basic | ~$5 |
| Log Analytics | Pay-per-GB | ~$2-5 |
| **Total** | | **~$100-115/month** |

Scale-to-zero on Container Apps keeps compute low when idle. **Azure AI Search Basic does not scale to zero** — it is the main ongoing cost (~$75/mo). Tear down the same day with `azd down --force --purge` unless you intentionally keep the lab running.

<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

## Troubleshooting

### API won't start

**Check:** Your runtime version and dependencies.

```bash
node --version    # Node.js (need LTS)
python --version  # Python (need 3.10+)
dotnet --version  # .NET (need 8+)
java --version    # Java (need 17+)
```

### Semantic search returns no results

**Cause:** The search index is empty. Products haven't been pushed to Azure AI Search.

**Fix:** Run the indexing script to push products:

```
> Push all products from the data store to the Azure AI Search index.
```

### Chat assistant gives generic answers

**Cause:** The system prompt doesn't include product catalog context, or the product fetch is failing.

**Fix:** Check that the `/api/chat` endpoint fetches current products and includes them in the system message. The assistant needs real product data to give specific recommendations.

```
> The shopping assistant isn't mentioning specific products. 
  Check that the chat endpoint includes the product catalog in the system prompt.
```

### Frontend loads but products don't appear

**Cause:** `VITE_API_URL` was set without the `/api` path segment when the Docker image was built.

**Check:** Open browser dev tools → Network tab. Are requests going to `https://ca-api-.../products` (missing `/api`)? They should go to `https://ca-api-.../api/products`.

**Fix:** Rebuild the frontend image in Azure Container Registry with the checked-in hook, which passes `VITE_API_URL` including `/api`:
```text
node infra/hooks/postdeploy.js
```

### Deployment fails with provider errors

**Fix:** Register Azure providers before deploying:

```bash
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Search
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.CognitiveServices
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
```

### Orders or inventory changes disappear after a while

**Cause:** The default deployment uses SQLite inside the API container. When the container restarts or scales to zero, that data is gone (see the Data persistence note in the Architecture section).

**Fix:** Expected behavior for this lab. For persistence, ask GitHub Copilot to add a Cosmos DB or PostgreSQL module and switch `DATA_PROVIDER`. (If you did switch providers and see connection timeouts, check that the connection string env var is set on the API container and ask GitHub Copilot to check the container logs.)

### Docker Build Fails

**Build context too large:**
Check that `client/.dockerignore` and `api/.dockerignore` exclude `node_modules/`, `.git/`, and build output directories.

**Wrong image platform:**
Require the postdeploy hook to pass `--platform linux/amd64` to `az acr build`. Do not fall back to a local cross-build.

**Frontend can't find the API (`VITE_API_URL` not set):**
The `ARG VITE_API_URL` line must come BEFORE the `npm run build` step in `client/Dockerfile`. If it's after, the build arg is silently ignored.

<summary>Verification Checklist</summary>

## Verification Checklist

Run `node scripts/verify-deployment.mjs`. It must read `API_URL` and `WEB_URL` through `azd`, assert all ten products, semantic ranking, a grounded chat response, HTTP 200 from the storefront, the production API URL in the built frontend, and successful loading of every product image.

</details>

---

## Cleanup

```bash
azd down --force --purge
```

Teardown takes 3-5 minutes. This deletes all Azure resources. If you created the AI services separately, delete those too:

If you created a separate temporary AI resource group, delete only its recorded exact name with `az group delete --name <temporary-ai-resource-group> --yes --no-wait`, then verify that exact group is gone.

## Key Learnings

- **The spec is the prompt**: hand GitHub Copilot a well-written plan and it generates code that matches
- **Delegate with context**: the GitHub Copilot cloud agent produces better PRs when your repo has a spec it can read
- **Ground your AI in real data**: the shopping assistant works because it gets the product catalog as context, not because the LLM memorized products
- **AI features are APIs**: semantic search and chat are REST endpoints backed by Azure services; no ML expertise required
- **Start with SQLite, swap to cloud when you need persistence**: the deployed default is still SQLite (ephemeral container storage), and the repository pattern is what makes the Cosmos DB / PostgreSQL swap a one-variable change instead of a rewrite

---

## Assignment

1. Add a new AI feature: ask GitHub Copilot to *"Add a product recommendations endpoint that suggests similar products based on category and price range using Microsoft Foundry"*
2. Add order confirmation: ask GitHub Copilot to *"When an order is placed, use Microsoft Foundry to generate a personalized thank-you message that mentions the products purchased"*
3. Clean up with `azd down --force --purge`
